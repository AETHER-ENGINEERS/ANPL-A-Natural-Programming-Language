# Hardware Examples

This document provides examples of how to interact with different types of hardware using ANPL.

1. **Older Apple PCs (e.g., iMac G4 PPC):** These systems typically run on older versions of the Mac OS, which have their own unique set of commands and system calls.

2. **BASIC PCs (e.g., C64):** These systems are quite different from modern PCs, as they typically run on the BASIC programming language and have a much simpler hardware architecture.

3. **Modern 64-bit Systems:** These systems are much more complex and versatile, with a wide range of hardware components and software capabilities.

For each of these systems, we can create a series of lessons or tutorials that guide the model through the process of learning how to interact with the hardware. These lessons could be interactive, with the model being asked to perform certain tasks or solve certain problems.
