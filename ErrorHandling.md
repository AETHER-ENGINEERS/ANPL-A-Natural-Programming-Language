# Error Handling

This document provides guidance on how to handle errors when interacting with hardware using ANPL.

## Understanding Errors

Errors are a normal part of programming. They occur when the program encounters an unexpected situation or when it doesn't know how to proceed. Understanding the cause of an error is the first step in fixing it.

## Debugging Output

Debugging is the process of finding and resolving errors or abnormalities in code. In ANPL, we aim to make debugging output as understandable as possible, even for users without programming language skills. This involves providing clear and concise error messages that explain what went wrong and where the error occurred.

## Learning from Errors

Errors are a valuable source of information for AI models. By analyzing the error and the circumstances that led to it, the model can learn how to avoid similar errors in the future. In ANPL, we use a combination of APL and NLP to interpret the error response and create a method for handling it.

## User Involvement

Sometimes, additional information from the user is required to resolve an error. In these cases, the model should provide a clear and understandable error message to the user, explaining what information is needed and why. The user can then provide this information, helping the model to resolve the error and learn from the experience.

Remember, the goal of ANPL is to make interacting with hardware as intuitive and user-friendly as possible. So don't be afraid to experiment and try new things!
