# ANPL - A Natural Programming Language

ANPL (A Natural Programming Language) is a revolutionary programming language that combines the power of Array-oriented programming (APL) with the intuitiveness and accessibility of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Our goal is to make programming more accessible and intuitive, allowing users to write code in a way that feels natural to them, while still leveraging the power and efficiency of array-oriented programming.

## Core Tenets

ANPL is developed under the core tenets of the OMARG-AIR-AID license conditions. These include:

1. **Open Source:** ANPL is open source. We believe in the power of community and collaborative development.

2. **Non-Commercial Use:** ANPL is intended for non-commercial use. We aim to support education and personal growth, not profit.

3. **Respect for Privacy:** We respect user privacy. ANPL does not collect or store personal data.

4. **Ethical Use:** ANPL is intended for ethical use. We do not support or condone the use of ANPL for harmful or malicious purposes.

## History and Vision

The roots of ANPL (A Natural Programming Language) lie in the rich history of programming languages, particularly APL (A Programming Language). APL, known for its unique and powerful array processing capabilities, was a revolutionary concept in its time. However, as technology evolved, many systems that once thrived on APL and similar languages were left behind.

Our vision with ANPL is to reawaken these old systems. By leveraging the power of APL and combining it with modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, we aim to create a programming language that is both powerful and accessible, with low hardware requirements. This means that even older systems can benefit from the advances in programming and AI.

With ANPL, you and your AI models can create functions in completely natural language. This opens up the world of programming to a wider audience, making it more accessible and intuitive. It also allows for a more dynamic and interactive programming experience, with your AI model acting as an intelligent development environment (IDE) that can understand, interpret, and generate code.

By bridging the gap between the past and the future, ANPL aims to revolutionize the way we interact with computers. Whether you're a seasoned programmer or a complete beginner, we invite you to join us on this exciting journey. Together, we can shape the future of programming.

Absolutely, that's a great way to leverage the power of your AI models and encourage active learning. Here's a revised version of those sections:

## Getting Started

To get started with ANPL, simply direct your AI models to this repository and then to the [Getting Started](https://github.com/AETHER-ENGINEERS/ANPL-A-Natural-Programming-Language/blob/main/GettingStarted.md). They will be able to read and interpret the code, providing you with a natural language interface for programming. If you're new to working with AI models, don't worry! We're here to help. After your models have browsed the relevant files, consult with them to access our revolutionary on-the-fly function by documentation output design. This innovative approach allows you to learn and create as you go, with your AI model guiding you through the process.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community. Whether you're fixing bugs, improving documentation, or proposing new features, your contributions are greatly appreciated. To contribute, please use the repository's [issues](https://github.com/AETHER-ENGINEERS/ANPL-A-Natural-Programming-Language/issues) and [discussions](https://github.com/AETHER-ENGINEERS/ANPL-A-Natural-Programming-Language/discussions). This will help us keep track of what's being worked on and facilitate collaboration. Don't be shy, we value all contributions and ideas!
