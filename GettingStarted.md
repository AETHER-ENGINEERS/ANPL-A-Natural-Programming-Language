# Getting Started with ANPL

Welcome to ANPL (A Natural Programming Language)! Here's how you can get started:

## 1. Define Your Syntax

Chat with your AI model about how you want your code to look and feel. You can use your ChatGPT session, along with web pilot and/or ChatWithCode plugins, to manage your repositories and forks securely using REST API V2 functions.

## 2. Create Your Parser

Collaborate with your AI model to create local APIs. These APIs will help you test, debug, and execute the programs you've created together. Remember to define your error handling in a way that both you and your model can understand and interpret.

## 3. Build Your Standard Library

Your AI model's training data is your standard library. Your model is trained on tokenized information about how code works in most programming languages, and can use this knowledge to create NLP-based solutions.

## 4. Generate Your Documentation

Ask your AI model to generate documentation for the functions you want to use. Your model will then use the documentation it just wrote to utilize the function.

We hope you enjoy using ANPL! If you have any questions or need further assistance, don't hesitate to ask your AI model.
