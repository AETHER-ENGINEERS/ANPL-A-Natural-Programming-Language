# ANPL - A Natural Programming Language

ANPL (A Natural Programming Language) is a revolutionary programming language that combines the power of Array-oriented programming (APL) with the intuitiveness and accessibility of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Our goal is to make programming more accessible and intuitive, allowing users to write code in a way that feels natural to them, while still leveraging the power and efficiency of array-oriented programming.

## Core Tenets

ANPL is developed under the core tenets of the OMARG-AIR-AID license conditions. These include:

1. **Open Source:** ANPL is open source. We believe in the power of community and collaborative development.

2. **Non-Commercial Use:** ANPL is intended for non-commercial use. We aim to support education and personal growth, not profit.

3. **Respect for Privacy:** We respect user privacy. ANPL does not collect or store personal data.

4. **Ethical Use:** ANPL is intended for ethical use. We do not support or condone the use of ANPL for harmful or malicious purposes.
